# `Rock Paper Scissors` â€” simple rock paper scissors app, scaffolded using the Angular Seed app

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `rockPaperScissors repository. You can get git from [here][git].

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `Rock Paper Scissors`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Clone `rockPaperScissors`

Clone the `rockPaperScissors` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Djangofs/rockPaperScissors.git
cd rockPaperScissors
```

### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  components/           --> all app specific modules
    version/              --> version related components
      version.js                 --> version module declaration and basic "version" value service
      version_test.js            --> "version" value service tests
      version-directive.js       --> custom directive that returns the current app version
      version-directive_test.js  --> version directive tests
      interpolate-filter.js      --> custom interpolation filter
      interpolate-filter_test.js --> interpolate filter tests
  view1/                --> the view1 view template and logic
    view1.html            --> the partial template
    homeView.js              --> the controller logic
    homeView_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  view2/                --> the view2 view template and logic
    view2.html            --> the partial template
    view2.js              --> the controller logic
    view2_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index-async.html      --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
```


## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

The `angular-seed` app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine],
which we run with the [Karma][karma] test runner. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* The configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`.
* The unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and have an `_test.js` suffix (e.g.
  `homeView_test.js`).

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will start
watching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them
changes.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```
